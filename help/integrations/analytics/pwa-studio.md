# PWA studio headless Integration between Adobe Analytics and Adobe Commerce

It was a dog. It was a big dog. I'm not wearing hockey pads. I'm Batman I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham.

 Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended. Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages. The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.

 It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me. Does it come in black? This isn't a car. It was a dog. It was a big dog. I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham.

 I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham. I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.
