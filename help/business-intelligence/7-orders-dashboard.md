# MBI - Orders dashboard

On the Orders dashboard, you can view average order values, orders by status, coupon usage, and breakdowns of shipping and tax collected by
billing and shipping region. If you open the Orders by Status report and see a spike in the processing or pending status, you can create a report for at all orders in that status during that timeframe. You can then and break it down by email and order ID and generate an email
summary to be sent automatically to your warehouse manager for followup.
