# MBI - SQL Report Builder

The SQL Report Builder allows you to directly query your data warehouse, view the results, and quickly transform them into a chart. The best part about using SQL to build reports is that you don't have to wait on update cycles to iterate on columns you create. If the results don't look right, you can quickly edit and rerun the query until things match your expectations.
