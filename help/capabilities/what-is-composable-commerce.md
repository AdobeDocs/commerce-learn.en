# Learn how Adobe creates composable commerce

Learn about Adobe Commerce's investment in composable development tools and AI-powered personalization to enhance the e-commerce experience.

## What is composable commerce

Composable commerce is an architectural approach in e-commerce that involves decoupling the front-end presentation layer from the back-end commerce functionality. ​ It allows businesses to select and combine the best components or modules to create a customized solution. This approach involves breaking down the traditional monolithic e-commerce platform into smaller, independent services or microservices that can be composed together. Composable commerce offers benefits such as flexibility, scalability, customization, agility, and the ability for easier integrations with other systems and technologies. ​ Adobe Commerce provides many capabilities and tools for supporting merchants in adopting and implementing composable commerce. Adobe Commerce offers a composable commerce methodology and hybrid headless and non-headless front-end experiences. With the out of process extensibility in mind, Adobe offers API Mesh for integrating multiple services, and Adobe App Builder for creating custom microservices. ​

## Why is composable commerce important

Understanding composable commerce is important for businesses and individuals involved in the e-commerce industry for several reasons. ​ It provides flexibility and customization, scalability and agility, integration capabilities, future-proofing, and developer empowerment. Composable commerce enables businesses to adapt and evolve their e-commerce platforms, scale and grow their operations. A few more impressive benefits include the ability to integrate with other systems and technologies, keep up with evolving customer expectations, and leverage the expertise of developers. ​ It helps businesses navigate the evolving e-commerce landscape, make informed decisions, and leverage the benefits of flexibility, scalability, customization, agility, and integration capabilities. Additionally, knowing about composable commerce is important for business growth, customization, agility and innovation, cost efficiency, integration and flexibility, and future-proofing. ​ It enables businesses the opportunity for quick adaption for new features and respond to changing market conditions, create highly customized solutions. There are more benefits that include the ability to innovate rapidly, reduce development and maintenance costs, and integrate with third-party services and systems. ​ Overall, understanding composable commerce empowers businesses to make informed decisions, optimize their e-commerce architecture and strategy, and drive growth and success in the digital marketplace. ​

## How can companies benefit from composable commerce

Companies can benefit from composable commerce in several ways:

Flexibility and Customization: Composable commerce allows companies to select and combine the best components or microservices to create a customized e-commerce solution that meets their specific needs. ​ It enables businesses to tailor their platform to deliver unique customer experiences, implement specialized functionalities, and differentiate themselves in the market. ​

Scalability and Agility: With a composable architecture, companies can scale different components of their e-commerce platform independently. ​ This means they can allocate resources and scale specific functionalities based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency. Composable commerce also enables agile development practices, allowing teams to work on different components simultaneously and deploy changes independently, resulting in faster time-to-market. ​

Integration Capabilities: Composable commerce facilitates seamless integration with third-party systems, services, and technologies. ​ Companies can easily connect their e-commerce platform with various tools such as payment gateways, ERP systems, CRM systems, marketing automation platforms, and more. ​ This integration capability enables businesses to leverage the best-of-breed solutions and create a unified ecosystem that enhances operational efficiency and customer experience.

Future-Proofing: Composable commerce provides companies with the flexibility to adapt and evolve their e-commerce platform as technology and market trends change. ​ It allows businesses to easily add or replace components, integrate new technologies, and stay ahead of the competition. This future-proofing capability ensures that companies can continuously innovate and meet evolving customer expectations.

Developer Empowerment: Composable commerce empowers developers by providing them with the flexibility to work with different technologies, languages, and frameworks. ​ It allows developers to focus on specific components or microservices, enabling specialization and expertise. This empowerment leads to increased developer productivity, faster development cycles, and the ability to leverage the latest tools and technologies.

Overall, composable commerce enables companies to create a highly flexible, scalable, and customizable e-commerce platform that can adapt to changing business needs, deliver exceptional customer experiences, and drive growth and success in the digital marketplace. ​

## What capabilities does Adobe Commerce have for composable commerce

Adobe Commerce provides several capabilities to support merchants in adopting and implementing composable commerce:

Composable Commerce Methodology: Adobe Commerce offers a composable commerce methodology that guides merchants in understanding and implementing the principles of composable architecture. ​ This methodology helps businesses leverage the benefits of flexibility, scalability, and customization while considering factors like complexity, technical maturity, and project size.

Feature-Rich Functionality: Adobe Commerce provides a comprehensive set of features accessible through its GraphQLAPI. ​ This feature-rich functionality allows merchants to minimize the number of vendors required in their commerce stack, reducing time-to-market challenges. ​ It enables businesses to launch faster while maintaining the flexibility to compose and integrate additional third-party services or capabilities as their commerce stack evolves. ​

Hybrid Front-End Experiences: Adobe Commerce supports both headless and non-headless front-end experiences within the same ecosystem. ​ This flexibility allows merchants to choose the most suitable architectural approach for each specific front-end use case. ​ It enables a gradual transition to a headless and composable architecture without the need for a simultaneous migration of the entire system.

API Mesh: Adobe Commerce's API Mesh simplifies the integration of multiple microservices, third-party tools, and applications into a unified API endpoint for front-end developers. ​ It allows developers to combine multiple data sources into a single GraphQL endpoint, reducing complexity and streamlining the development and maintenance of new features and experiences.

Adobe App Builder: Adobe App Builder is a serverless extensibility platform that allows merchants to create custom microservices, build custom experiences, and extend Adobe solutions. ​ With App Builder, merchants can build secure and scalable apps that extend Adobe Commerce's native functionality and integrate with third-party solutions. ​ This eliminates the need for merchants to build and maintain their own infrastructure for customizations and microservices, reducing complexity and lowering the total cost of ownership. ​

These capabilities provided by Adobe Commerce simplify the adoption and implementation of composable commerce, enabling merchants to leverage the benefits of flexibility, scalability, customization, and integration capabilities while reducing complexity and development effort. ​
