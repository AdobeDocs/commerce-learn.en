# Migrating to Adobe Commerce - Code Freeze

Implementing a code freeze during your Adobe Commerce migration is crucial for ensuring a stable and successful launch. By halting new code deployments, you allow the QA team, developers, and stakeholders to work with a static codebase, increasing confidence and reducing the risk of defects. This process involves thorough testing and validation, addressing high-priority bugs, and ensuring all aspects of the site function as expected. A well-executed code freeze benefits the entire project, preventing last-minute issues and ensuring a smooth transition to Adobe Commerce.
