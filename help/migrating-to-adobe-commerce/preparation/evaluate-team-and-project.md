# Migrating to Adobe Commerce - valuating the team and project

When moving to Adobe Commerce, it's crucial to evaluate your team and project thoroughly. Your team should include key roles such as project managers, QA testers, developers, business stakeholders, and technical leads. Assess the technical strengths of your team to ensure they align with your project goals. For instance, a strong background in JavaScript and backend integrations is ideal for leveraging Adobe Commerce and App Builder. If your team is more experienced with Java or PHP, consider partnering with Adobe Consulting Services for the App Builder portion.

On the frontend, experience with headless implementations can simplify the process. Adobe's Edge Delivery Services can enhance performance and speed up launch times with document-based authoring, allowing changes without a developer. Additionally, evaluate existing PHP modules and third-party extensions, and consider using pre-built App Builder modules to minimize custom code. Upgrading the core application requires careful planning, including removing unnecessary attributes and evaluating custom database tables to streamline data migration. Integrating Adobe Commerce with other Adobe solutions, such as Adobe Journey Optimizer and Real-time CDP, can further enhance your project's capabilities.
