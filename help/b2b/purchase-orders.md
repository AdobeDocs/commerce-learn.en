# Purchase Orders and Approvals

{{b2b-feature}}

Most B2B companies have order approval rules for purchase orders. Companies can control who can create purchase orders and how much they can spend. For example:

- Any PO less than X value is automatically approved.
- POs over X value but less than Q must be approved by Y.
- Any PO over X value must be approved by Y and Z.
- A PO created by anyone at the Director level or above is automatically approved.

With the required permissions for their role, B2B customers can set up approval rules to enforce company policies.
