# Manage Shared Catalogs

{{b2b-feature}}

B2B for Adobe Commerce gives you the ability to maintain gated shared catalogs with custom pricing for different companies. In addition to the standard primary product catalog, it provides customer access to two types of shared catalogs with different pricing structures.

If the Shared Catalog feature is enabled in the configuration, the original primary catalog remains visible from the Admin, but only the Default (General) public shared catalog is visible from the storefront. In addition, custom catalogs can be created that are visible only to members of specific company accounts.
