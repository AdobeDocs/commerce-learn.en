# MBI - Data warehousing

A data warehouse is a relational database configured to consolidate and store data for running business analysis. Data warehouses allow access to data in order to de-normalize production databases and organize them for running analysis more efficiently. 

Using the Data Warehouse Manager, users with admin-level access can manage table and column sync settings, drill-down into a tableâ€™s schema, and create calculated columns to use in reports.
