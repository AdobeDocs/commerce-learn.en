# Overview

This tutorial makes an assumption that several prerequisites have been met.

* Adobe Developer Console access is complete
* Full access or trial access to App Builder has been granted
* The Adobe Developer App Builder application has been created
* The Adobe Developer App Builder project has been created
* The Adobe Developer App Builder workspaces have been created
* The AIO CLI commands to initialize the project and run have been executed

For more information on this, you can view this blog post to help with this initial setup and configuration [How App Builder helps drive business agility for your commerce platform](https://business.adobe.com/blog/how-to/how-app-builder-helps-you-implement-a-composable-commerce-strategy){target="_blank"}.

## What to expect from reading this tutorial

The goal when you are completed with following the pages in this tutorial is to have a simple single page application that communicates with Adobe Commerce to pull order history and products. Topics cover unique or interesting bits of functionality with code samples and instructions for where to place them in your repository. The intent is to explain some of the files that can be reused and save some development time. Hopefully, this inspires other ideas and encourages the adoption of out-of-process development patterns.

## How should I follow this tutorial

You can, and probably should follow it in the order of the linked pages on the left navigation and duplicated at the bottom of each page. However, this is not a requirement. Each page can be reviewed in isolation as they are just topics in the overall concept of building an initial Adobe Developer App Builder app.
