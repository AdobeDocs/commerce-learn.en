## Video content

## Example use cases

Your Commerce application has a REST API and a GraphQL endpoint. For example, you could use the REST API to apply special pricing or the GraphQL endpoint to handle inventory status. Using API Mesh, you can define both endpoints, retrieve the information, and return it to the requesting application as one response.

## What is a reverse proxy

As a developer using Adobe App Builder and API Mesh, it is not necessary to understand what a reverse proxy is. However, if you are interested in the overall functionality as it pertains to Adobe App Builder, use the following resources:
