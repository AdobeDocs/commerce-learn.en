# Get started with API Mesh

If you're new to API Mesh, Adobe recommends starting with this introductory tutorial before digging in to the accompanying videos and tutorials.

## What is API Mesh

API Mesh allows for multiple sources of data to be used to provide a single response for your commerce application to consume. 

[View the full API Mesh documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/graphql-mesh-gateway/gateway/overview/)

## Example use cases

The backend system for your Commerce application has a REST API you can use to get special pricing. Another backend system that has a GraphQL endpoint handles inventory status. Using API Mesh, you can define both endpoints, retrieve the information and return it to the requesting application as one response.
