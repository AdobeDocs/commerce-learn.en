## Learn about the Adobe Developer Console

In the Adobe Developer Console, the following hierarchy represents how your APIs fit into your Organization: `Organization > Project > Workspace > [API]`. To learn more about Adobe App Builder, logging in to the console, and basic troubleshooting, visit [Creating your First App Builder Application](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/getting_started/first_app/){target="_blank"}.

## Introduction to Projects in the Adobe Developer Console

All development work in Adobe Developer Console is done as part of a project. A project can include one or multiple products, and a combination of APIs, events, runtimes, and plugins. For more details on projects in Adobe Developer console, visit [Projects](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/projects/){target="_blank"}.

For more information on using projects and workspaces in the context of API Mesh, see [Modify projects and workspaces](https://developer.adobe.com/graphql-mesh-gateway/gateway/create-mesh/#modify-projects-and-workspaces){target="_blank"}.
