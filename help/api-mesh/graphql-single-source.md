# Create a mesh with a single source

This video helps developers understand how to create a mesh with a single source in API Mesh for Adobe Developer App Builder. For this basic example to work as expected, you need a publicly accessible API or GraphQL endpoint. The video also explains how to create a simple `mesh.json` file to use with your Commerce instance. For more details and code samples, visit [Create a mesh](https://developer.adobe.com/graphql-mesh-gateway/gateway/create-mesh/#create-a-mesh-1){target="_blank"}.

## Who is this video for?

## Create the json configuration file

API Mesh uses a JSON configuration file to define your source handlers. The JSON file contains a `sources` array that contains the sources for your mesh. Here is an example of a mesh with a single source.

```json
{
"meshConfig": {
    "sources": [
      {
        "name": "Commerce",
        "handler": {
          "graphql": {
            "endpoint": "https://venia.magento.com/graphql/"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
