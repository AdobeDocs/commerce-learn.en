# Content Staging

Content Staging gives your business team the ability to easily create, preview, and schedule a wide range of content updates for your store directly from the Admin. For example, rather than thinking in terms of a static page, consider a page to be a collection of different elements that can be added or removed according to schedule. You can use Content Staging to create a page that changes automatically throughout the year on schedule.
