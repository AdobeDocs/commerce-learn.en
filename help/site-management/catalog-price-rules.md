# Create a Catalog Price Rule

Catalog price rules can be used to offer products to buyers at a discounted price, based on a set of defined conditions. Catalog price rules do not use coupon codes because they are triggered before a product is placed into the shopping cart. For example, you can define and set the conditions for a price rule that when met, automatically display products with a special or promotional price.
