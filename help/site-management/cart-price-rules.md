# Create a Cart Price Rule

Cart price rules apply discounts to items in the shopping cart, based on a set of conditions. The discount can be applied automatically when the conditions are met, or when the customer enters a valid coupon code. When applied, the discount appears in the cart under the subtotal. A cart price rule can be used as needed for a season or promotion by changing its status and date range.
