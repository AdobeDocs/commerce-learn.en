# Business Intelligence - Share results and export data

Business Intelligence users can be granted read-only, standard, or admin permission levels to control who sees specific parts of the business data. And the benefits are not limited to Business Intelligence users---schedule and send email summaries to as many email addresses as needed. Data from the data warehouse can be exported using the Export API.
