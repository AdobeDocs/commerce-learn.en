# Business Intelligence - Overview

Business Intelligence is a complete solution that has been optimized for all Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source merchants. There are three core components that make it a complete business intelligence solution: 

- _Data Replication and Consolidation_: It all starts with connecting your various data sources and bringing them together within a central location.
- _Data Warehousing_: To leverage all your data, it needs to be stored and made accessible in a way that is optimized for analyses. BI includes a hosted data warehouse component. 
- _Dashboard and Visualization_: When all your data has been connected, centralized, and stored, Business Intelligence provides a frontend interface for you to analyze it. 

With these three core pieces of technology built into one solution, merchants are using Business Intelligence to: 

- Save time
- Gain insights from their business data
- Empower teams across their organization
