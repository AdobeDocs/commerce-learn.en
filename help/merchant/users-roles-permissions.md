# Users, user roles, and permissions

If there are others on your team or service providers who need access, you can create a separate user account for each and assign restricted access based on their business needs. To limit the websites or stores that Admin users can access, you must first create a role with limited scope and only the necessary resources selected. Then, you can assign the role to a specific user account. Admin users who are assigned to a restricted role can see and change data only for websites or stores that are associated with the role, but cannot change any global settings or data.
