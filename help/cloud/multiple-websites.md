# Adobe Commerce Multiple Website Management

Adobe Commerce empowers businesses to manage multiple stores, brands, or websites from a single backend interface without requiring technical skills. It allows the creation of multiple websites, each with its own domain, products, pricing, and customer base. Within a website, multiple stores can be created, each with its own catalog and pricing, and within a store, multiple store views can be set up for different languages or versions. This flexibility ensures efficient management of product offerings and pricing strategies, making it ideal for businesses looking to expand and scale their e-commerce operations.
