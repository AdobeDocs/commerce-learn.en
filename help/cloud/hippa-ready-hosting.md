Adobe Commerce offers a HIPAA-ready solution designed to help healthcare businesses comply with HIPAA regulations. This solution includes built-in security and privacy controls, enhanced logging mechanisms for PHI, and integration capabilities with both internal and external services. Additionally, Adobe Commerce provides a dedicated staging environment for support and troubleshooting, ensuring that sensitive data is protected. The HIPAA-ready hosting differs from traditional hosting. A few key differences are disabling a few core features and provisioning customers in a HIPAA-ready region. This setup is ideal for businesses dealing with medical supplies, equipment requests, and insurance payments.
