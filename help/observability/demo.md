# Observability demo

Watch a live demo of observability in Adobe Commerce. This demo shows how webhooks and event workflows connect different services to make order tracking and problem-solving easier. You’ll see how orders are placed, errors are fixed, and processes are checked while learning about synchronous and asynchronous flows. It also explains how traces and logs appear in Grafana and New Relic for troubleshooting, and why correlation is important for finding slow spots and keeping systems working smoothly.
